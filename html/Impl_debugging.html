    <h3>Stubs</h3>
    <p>
      Stubs are placeholders in a system, that take the place of specific
      modules or subroutines to be coded later. Stubs can also be used as a
      substitute for existing subroutines when trying to locate an error
      in the code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stubs are useful as they allow the program to run without stopping for
      syntax or runtime errors, so developers are able to check that everything
      works the way it is supposed to. No processing happens inside the stub.

      Flags are boolean variables
