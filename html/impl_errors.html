        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Syntax Errors</h3>
            <p>It is an error in the source code of the program, when the source code statements do not adhere to the rules of the specific programming language you are programming in.</p>
            <p>These errors are caught during the translation of the code from source code to object code.</p>
            <p>A program will not complile until all syntax erros are corrected. In interpreted languages, syntax erros can be detected in program execution.</p>
            <h3>Logic Errors</h3>
            <p>Logic errors are mistakes made by the programmer which causes the program to not operate in the intended way, but not crash.</p>
            <p>It is hard to catch logic errors as there is nothing ‘wrong’ with the code, there is something wrong with the logic of the code.</p>
            <p>Logic errors can be a problem in the processing done, meaning that the output will not be correct.</p>
            <p>As the incorrect output is the most clear sign of a logic error, they can be very hard to catch, but using <a href="Impl_debugging.html">debugging techniques</a>, you can find and correct them.</p>
