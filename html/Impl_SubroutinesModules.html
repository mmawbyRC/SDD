    <h2>Key Terms</h2>
    <h5> Subroutines: </h5>
    <p> Software developed using top-down design is comprised of a series of subroutines. Subroutines are also called subprograms or procedures. The terms subroutine and subprogram imply a lower level process whereas the term procedure refers to its sequence of statements. The highest level routine is known as the main program. The main program contains calls to lower level subroutines. In turn these subroutines call lower level subroutines and so on. </p>
    <h5> Module: </h5>
    <p> A module, in the broader sense of the word, refers to a self-contained unit. In terms of software development, modules are groups or libraries of related subroutines designed so they can be reused both within the same application and in other applications. Programs are composed of one or more individually developed programs that are not combined until they are all linked through the program. </p>
    <h5> Modularity: </h5>
    <p> Modularity refers to the ability to reuse modules as a result of their independent nature. </p>
