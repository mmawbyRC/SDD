    <h1>Methods of Combining Code</h1>
    <h3> Copy-Paste </h3>
    <p> The easiest method of combining code is copying and pasting the code
        from the operating systems clipboard. This method only works however
        when the code is written in the same language and version.

    <h1>Methods of integrating code</h1>
    <h3>Adjusting Terminology/Lexical Translation</h3>
    <p> When copying and pasting code from a source where the code is written in
        a different language or version, changes need to be made to the code, to
        ensure that the code will work. These adjustments could consist of changing
        terminology or making grammatical changes, to ensure the code complies with
        the lexicon.
       </p>
    <h3>Importing Files</h3>
    <p> Modern programming environments allow external modules of code to be
        incorporated into the source code. Source code can be stored in single
        library files, that can then be compiled and included in the projects
        executable files. External modules can be stored in dynamic link libraries,
        objects or new controls. </p>


    <h1>Considerations when combining code</h1>
    <h3>Intellectual property rights of author</h3>
    <p> In all cases, it is unethical to use code created by others without ensuring
        all intellectual property rights are upheld. This can be done through a
        a copyright notice, that acknowledges that the code has been created by
        someone else, and the new application complies with an other licensing agreements. </p>
